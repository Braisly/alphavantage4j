*A Java wrapper to get stock data and stock indicators from the Alpha Vantage API*

Vantage (http://www.alphavantage.co/). It requires an api key, that can be requested on http://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key. You can have a look at all the api 
calls available in their documentation http://www.alphavantage.co/documentation

## Usage

String message = "TODO"
```

easily create project files with gradle:
